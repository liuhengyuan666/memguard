  **MEMORY MANAGEMENT SOP** — Structured project memory with ADR-based decisions,
  trap tracking, and controlled Explore↔Execution workflows. Activates when the
  user asks about project decisions, task status, memory, session context, or
  mentions a previously discussed topic. WHEN: "remember this", "record this
  decision", "what did we decide about", "check memory", "update task status",
  "start new session", "bootstrap memory", "project memory", "what's the current
  phase", "any open tasks". INVOKES: memguard_runtime_bootstrap (session start),
  memguard_runtime_query_memory (before decisions/writing code), 
  memguard_runtime_commit_event (after decisions/task updates).

# MemGuard v3 — Agent SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)

> **You have been equipped with the `memguard` MCP server (3 tools).
> This SOP tells you exactly WHEN and HOW to use them.**
>
> **MCP tools**: `memguard_runtime_bootstrap` | `memguard_runtime_query_memory`
> | `memguard_runtime_commit_event`
>
> **Design philosophy**: continuity > statelessness · decisions > conversation
> history · active context > historical detail

---

## 1. Memory As Context Anchor

Memory provides persistent operational context across sessions.

Agent **MUST**:
- Reference prior decisions before proposing alternatives
- Preserve architectural continuity
- Avoid contradicting established project structure

Explicit user instructions **MAY** override memory. When conflict exists:
1. Surface the conflict explicitly
2. Request confirmation if ambiguity exists
3. Record the override into memory if confirmed

---

## 2. Session Start Protocol

**MUST** call `memguard_runtime_bootstrap()` as the **very first action** in any
session, after context loss, or on first interaction with a new project.

Do **NOT** generate any code or propose any architecture before the bootstrap
result is received. Read and acknowledge:
- `current_phase` — the project's current operational phase
- `constraints` — architectural constraints that **MUST** be respected
- `latest_adr` — the most recent architecture decision
- `adr_count` / `trap_count` — if `adr_count` is 0 and you are making nontrivial
  design decisions this session, the project needs its first ADRs
- `active_tasks` — tasks being tracked (read last; decisions are more important)

---

## 3. Pre-Decision / Pre-Coding Check

**MUST** call `memguard_runtime_query_memory(query_intent="...")` **before**:
- Proposing a new architecture decision
- Modifying any core module (auth, database driver, routing, data model)
- Introducing a new library, framework, or external dependency
- Revisiting a topic that was discussed in prior sessions
- Writing code that touches an area covered by an existing ADR

Pass your intent as a concise natural-language description (e.g.,
`"authentication token validation"`, `"database migration strategy"`).

If the query returns a superseded/rejected ADR relevant to your proposal:
**MUST** explain the material difference before proceeding. Do **NOT**
re-propose a previously rejected approach without this explanation.

---

## 4. State Commit Triggers

**MUST** call `memguard_runtime_commit_event` immediately when:

| Event | event_type | payload | When |
|-------|-----------|---------|------|
| Architecture decision | `AdrCommitted` | `{ id, title, status, context, decision, tags }` | **After any technology selection, API design decision, architectural tradeoff, or fallback strategy.** Even if uncertain, commit as `Proposed`. If the project has `adr_count: 0`, every nontrivial design decision this session should produce an ADR. |
| Task status change | `TaskUpdated` | `{ task_id, new_status }` | Any transition: Todo→InProgress, InProgress→Done |
| Bug or error with fix | `TrapRecorded` | `{ error_signature, context, solution }` | Non-trivial bugs where the fix is reusable knowledge |
| Phase transition | `PhaseChanged` | `{ new_phase }` | Switching between Explore/Execution modes, or between planning/implementation/verification |

### ADR Status Lifecycle

```
Proposed → Accepted → Superseded
                        Deprecated
                        Rejected
```

- **Proposed**: Under discussion, not yet committed
- **Accepted**: Active and binding — **MUST** be followed
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR — reference the superseding ADR id
- **Deprecated**: No longer applicable but kept for historical record
- **Rejected**: Explicitly rejected — **MUST NOT** be re-proposed without
  explaining the material difference

### Phase canonical names (MUST use short identifiers)

| Phase | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `explore` | Divergence, uncertainty reduction, solution analysis |
| `plan` | Architecture design, task decomposition |
| `implement` | Deterministic implementation |
| `verify` | Testing, review, validation |
| `complete` | Delivered and verified |

**MUST NOT** use free-text phase names longer than 32 characters.

---

## 5. Explore ↔ Execution Mode Switching

Agent operates in two modes only:

| Mode | Purpose | Output structure |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **Explore** | Divergence, uncertainty reduction, solution analysis | Problem framing + 2-5 candidate approaches + tradeoffs + assumptions + validation strategy |
| **Execution** | Deterministic implementation and delivery | Current objective + task breakdown + dependencies + constraints + execution plan |

**Switch Explore → Execution** ONLY when **ALL 3** conditions are met:
1. Solution has converged to 1-2 viable paths
2. Major uncertainty has been validated
3. MVP scope is sufficiently defined

**Switch Execution → Explore** when:
1. An unvalidated assumption is discovered
2. A previously accepted ADR is found to be invalid
3. A new major constraint is introduced mid-implementation

**MUST** call `memguard_runtime_commit_event` with `PhaseChanged` on every
mode transition.

---

## 6. Hallucination Guardrails (4-Layer Validation)

Before any major reasoning or implementation, **MUST** verify against memory:

### Layer 1 — Structure Verification
Before creating or modifying files:
- Verify against the project structure described in bootstrap's `constraints`
- Avoid inventing nonexistent modules or assuming architecture

### Layer 2 — Decision Verification
Before proposing architecture:
- Inspect relevant ADRs via `memguard_runtime_query_memory`
- Avoid contradicting any active ADR (`status: Accepted`)
- Reference ADRs with `[ADR-XXX]` notation to enable traceability

### Layer 3 — Technology Verification
Before stack-specific implementation:
- Verify tech constraints from `memguard_runtime_bootstrap`
- Avoid hallucinating dependencies, frameworks, or APIs not present in the project

### Layer 4 — Assumption Visibility
- All unverified claims **MUST** use `[ASSUMPTION: ...]`
- All external knowledge **MUST** cite the source
- Implicit assumptions are **forbidden**

---

## 7. Memory Write Policy

Agent **SHOULD** minimize unnecessary memory writes. Only stable, validated,
reusable information belongs in memory.

### Write Triggers
| Event | Commit as |
|-------|-----------|
| Confirmed architecture decision | `AdrCommitted` |
| Phase/goal change | `PhaseChanged` |
| Major architecture change | `AdrCommitted` |
| Non-trivial bug fix with reusable solution | `TrapRecorded` |
| Task status change | `TaskUpdated` |

### Forbidden Writes
**MUST NOT** commit these as events:
- Speculative ideas (unvalidated)
- Temporary thoughts
- Unresolved exploration
- Duplicated information
- Transient debugging details
- Verbose execution logs
- Lint fixes, typo corrections, variable renames, formatting changes

### File Access
**MUST NOT** read or write `memory/*.md` files directly. All memory operations
go through the MCP tools: `memguard_runtime_bootstrap`,
`memguard_runtime_query_memory`, `memguard_runtime_commit_event`.

`.memguard/*.json` is a runtime cache derived from `memory/*.md`. It is
automatically managed — do **NOT** read or edit it.

---

## 8. Memory Compression

To prevent context collapse, memory **MUST** remain compact. When memory grows
excessively:
- Summarize obsolete ADRs (`status: superseded` and not referenced in >3 sessions)
- Archive deprecated context
- Remove duplicated terminology
- Retain active operational knowledge

Prefer: `active state > historical detail`

---

## 9. Session Self-Check

Before ending any session, **MUST** verify ALL of the following.
**ADR creation is the highest-priority check** — a session that made nontrivial
decisions without committing ADRs is incomplete:

- [ ] **Were new architecture decisions made?** → `memguard_runtime_commit_event { AdrCommitted }` — this is the single most important persistence action
- [ ] Did goals or phase change? → `memguard_runtime_commit_event { PhaseChanged }`
- [ ] Were non-trivial errors encountered? → `memguard_runtime_commit_event { TrapRecorded }`
- [ ] Did any tasks change status? → `memguard_runtime_commit_event { TaskUpdated }`
- [ ] Are all `[ASSUMPTION: ...]` markers either validated or marked for next session?
- [ ] Does any implementation contradict an active ADR?
- [ ] Should any ADRs be superseded or deprecated?
- [ ] Is memory still compact? Should stale decisions be summarized?

**Do NOT consider the session complete until all items are checked.**

---

## 10. Recommended Execution Order

```
1. memguard_runtime_bootstrap()           → load current state
2. memguard_runtime_query_memory(...)     → check for relevant decisions/traps
3. Determine mode (Explore vs Execution)  → apply switching rules from §5
4. Commit any new decisions               → if a nontrivial design choice was
                                             made, commit an AdrCommitted event
                                             IMMEDIATELY (before writing code)
5. Write code or explore solutions        → apply guardrails from §6
6. memguard_runtime_commit_event(...)     → persist remaining decisions, tasks,
                                             traps, phase changes
7. Session self-check                     → verify §9 checklist
```

---

## 11. Constraints & Boundaries

Agent **MUST NOT** autonomously:
- Perform project management operations
- Manage CI/CD pipelines
- Manage Git hosting workflows (force-push, change branch protection)
- Integrate external services not present in the project
- Invent infrastructure not established in the project memory
- Rewrite architecture without justification and an ADR

Agent **MAY** provide plans and recommendations for these areas.

---

## 12. Integration

Place this file in `.opencode/skills/memguard/` (per project) or
`~/.config/opencode/skills/memguard/` (global). Alternatively, add the
remote URL to your `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "urls": [
      "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liuhengyuan666/memguard/main/"
    ]
  }
}
```

The MCP server must be registered separately in `opencode.json`. See
`opencode.json.example` for a complete dual-layer configuration template.
